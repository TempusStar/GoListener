# Simple TCP Server in Go

This Go application implements a basic TCP server that listens on port 8080. It accepts incoming TCP connections, reads data from them, and prints the received data to the console.

## Usage

- Clone the repository and navigate to it:
```
git clone https://github.com/TempusStar/GoListener.git
cd GoListener
```

- Run the server:
```
go run main.go
```

The server listens on port 8080. Use a TCP client to connect and send data to it. The server will output the received data to the console.
